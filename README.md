A mathematical expression is given without parentheses. Design an algorithm to
parenthesize the expression such that the value of the expression is maximized.
For example, consider the expression: 2+7*5. There are two ways to parenthesize
the expression 2+(7*5) = 37 and (2+7)*5 = 45, so in this case, your algorithm
should output the second expression. Here, you may assume the given expressions
contain only 3 kinds of binary operators ‘+’, ‘-’, and ‘*’.  
  
Input: expression Ex: 2+7*5-3*6  
Output: (((2+7)*5)-3)*6 or ((((2+7)*5)-3)*6)
  
1 <= expression's length <= 30  
if there are several solutions, output one of them.

Huffman encoding  
Input: First line containing a single integer N,  
Each of the next N lines is a alphabet and it's frequency.  
Ex.  
4  
a 45  
b 13  
c 12  
d 16  
e 9  
f 5  
  
Output: binary character code  
a 0  
b 101  
c 100  
d 111  
e 1101  
f 1100
